This ten minute session slowly increases the intensity of pure, rhythmic light. you'll notice patterns and colors emerging as the light intensifies. It is not known if these patterns arise from the eyes, the optic nerve, or the brain. It is revealing the underlying structure of your visual processing. Bring all your attention to the patterns that arise, the stronger your attention, the more intense the patterns will be. This is because the patterns are operating on frequencies associated with focus. This powerful tool is a non-specific amplifier of the psyche. Your intention and attention have a profound influence on the experience you will have. Set the intention to maintain a high level of focus throughout this experience. | Take a breath and settle into your body. The light will begin gently and build gradually. You are safe and you can stop whenever you wish. Prepare to meet intensity with openness. Your only task is to observe without judgment. Resistance creates tension but acceptance creates space. Breathe naturally as the light begins. Notice any anticipation or curiosity arising. Whatever you see is your brain's natural response. The light is simply light, you are simply awareness. Allow the flickering rhythm to be exactly as it is. Notice the first hints of color appearing. Geometric patterns may begin to emerge now. Your visual cortex is creating imagery from pure rhythm. Watch the shapes forming and dissolving. These are called Kluver forms, fundamental visual patterns. Notice spirals, tunnels, lattices, or webs appearing. Your thalamus is synchronizing with the flickering frequency. Brainwave entrainment is guiding your neural rhythms. The patterns you see exist only in your consciousness. Notice how colors shift and pulse with the light. Geometric forms may rotate or expand outward. Your brain is dancing with the rhythm of light. Observe the kaleidoscopic display without grasping. Intensity becomes fascinating when you stop resisting it. Notice the intricate detail in each emerging pattern. Your visual system is revealing its own architecture. The thalamus acts as a conductor orchestrating this symphony. Witness the space where light becomes vision becomes consciousness. These patterns arise from the deepest structures of perception. Notice how the forms become more complex and vivid. Relax into focused attention. Your awareness remains steady while patterns dance and shift. Fascination replaces fear when you truly observe sensation. | This meditation is now complete, you may stay here as long as you want or finish when you are ready. When you are finished, notice how you feel in your body, and notice how your patterns of thought may have shifted.
