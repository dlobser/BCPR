This ten minute session slowly increases the intensity of pure, rhythmic light. you'll notice patterns and colors emerging as the light intensifies. It is not known if these patterns arise from the eyes, the optic nerve, or the brain. Bring all your attention to the patterns that arise, the stronger your attention, the more intense the patterns will be. This is because the patterns are operating on frequencies associated with focus. This powerful tool is a non-specific amplifier of the psyche. Your intention and attention have a profound influence on the experience you will have. Set the intention to maintain a high level of focus throughout this experience. | Take a breath and settle into your body. The light will begin gently and build gradually. You are safe and you can stop whenever you wish. Your only task is to observe. Breath naturally. Notice any boredom or discomfort, then bring your attention back to the light. Subtle geometric patterns may begin to emerge. Spirals, tunnels, lattices, or webs may appear. These are called Kluver forms, they reveal patterns of cells and connections between them. Relax into focused attention. | Thank you, brain. Thank you for everything. This session is now complete, you may stay here as long as you want or finish when you are ready. When you are finished, notice how you feel in your body, and notice how your patterns of thought may have shifted. Thank you.
