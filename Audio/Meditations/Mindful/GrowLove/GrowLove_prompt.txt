Welcome to the Gratitude for Love meditation. this practice helps you remember what love actually feels like in your body and then extend that feeling outward to yourself, to others, and to everything that exists. think of a time when you were deeply in love with someone, and let that memory fill you now. just pay attention to whatever arises as you recall that feeling. | Bring someone to mind who made your chest feel like it could barely contain what was inside it. Remember their face, their voice, the way the air changed when they walked into a room. Feel what your body did when you were near them. That warmth is not a memory, it is a capacity. It lives in you right now. You generated that feeling, it came from you. The other person was the occasion, but the love was yours. Notice where that warmth is sitting in your body at this moment. Let it pool there, let it gather weight and heat. Now bring that warmth to your forehead, let it rest there like a hand placed gently on your brow. Let it soften your jaw, you are probably holding your jaw tighter than you realize. Feel it pour down your neck and across your shoulders like warm water. Let your shoulders drop, they have been working so hard. Bring the warmth into your chest and let it expand there, ribs opening like a window. Feel it move down through your belly, softening everything it touches. Let it reach your hands, the same hands that once reached for someone you loved. Let it settle into your hips and your legs and the soles of your feet pressing against the ground. Your whole body knows how to hold this feeling, it has done it before. The feeling of love is not scarce, it is not something that runs out. Love does not need to be rationed, it is infinite. Give yourself permission right now to feel as much love as your body can hold. You do not need anyone's approval to feel this, You do not need a reason. Now take that feeling and aim it at yourself. Say, may I be happy. Say it like you mean it, because you should mean it. May I be at peace. May I be free from suffering. May I know that I am loved. Now think of someone you care about and send this same warmth to them. May you be happy. May you be at peace. Now think of someone neutral, someone you passed on the street or sat near on a bus. Send it to them too. May you be happy. Now think of someone difficult, someone who frustrates you, This is the hard one. See if you can send even a small amount of warmth in their direction, May you be happy. Now let the warmth expand past any single person. Send it to your neighborhood, your city, the strangers going about their lives right now. Expand it further, past borders, past oceans. May all beings be happy. May all beings be at peace. May all beings be free from suffering. You are not generating something new, you are uncorking something that was already there. Love is not a thing you find, it is a thing you are. Every time you felt it with another person, you were feeling your own capacity reflected back to you. That capacity does not leave when they do. You can access this anytime, in any moment, for any reason or no reason at all. The universe is not indifferent, it made you with this ability. The same forces that built stars built the part of you that can feel this. If you cannot be with the one you love, love the one you are with, and the one you are with is everyone. The one you are with is everything. The one you are with is you. | This Gratitude for Love meditation is now complete. the love you touched here does not belong to this session, it belongs to you, and you can return to it any time you place your attention on it. practice sending it outward once a day, even briefly, and watch what changes. thank you for being here, stay as long as you like or leave whenever you are ready.
