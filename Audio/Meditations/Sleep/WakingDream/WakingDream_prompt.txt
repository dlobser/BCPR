Find a comfortable position. Notice the weight of your body. The rhythm of your breath. In a moment, you'll be invited into a space between waking and sleeping. This is not an ordinary meditation, it is a waking dream crafted by a dream expert. Simply allow images to arise and pass, like watching clouds drift across an open sky. The experience will run continuously, stay as long as you like. | You are entering a waking dream. As you settle into stillness, your conscious mind begins to soften, its edges growing diffuse, its grip on ordinary perception loosening like sand sifting through open fingers. The sharp focus of waking attention blurs into something gentler, more receptive, more open to what lies beneath. Mysterious characters drift before you: faces—unfamiliar yet somehow recognized, as often in dreams, you find you simply know things about them: their emotions, their intentions, their histories, without needing to be told. Creatures of strange beauty and grace. vast architectures that belong to no earthly city, their spires and archways dissolving and reforming in slow procession. You know what these places are, the knowledge arriving whole and certain. These characters and places surface from the collective unconscious, that deep reservoir of symbol and story that flows beneath individual minds, connecting you to something far older and vaster than your single life. As this world passes before you, you remain serene, unhurried, buoyant. You are tranquil, cradled, weightless - as though floating in warm, still water. There is nothing to do but watch, enjoy, nothing to solve or analyze. Simply allow the delightful pageant to unfold, image flowing into image, each one arriving and departing in its own unhurried dream logic. Most of the time, you will be wholly absorbed, immersed so completely in this flowing world of image and symbol that you forget you are the one watching. The figures and landscapes will simply be - compelling and unquestioned - their meanings arriving unbidden, their stories unfolding without explanation, in a language older than words. Now and then, a flicker of awareness will arise: you will realize you are within a dream, awake inside the vision itself. In some paradoxical way, this knowing does not dispel the imagery but deepens it—colors grow richer, edges sharpen, the whole scene pulses with a strange, heightened presence as we now enter into this waking dream. | waking dream. stillness. your conscious mind softening. diffuse. loosening. sand sifting through open fingers. gentler. what lies beneath. mysterious characters. faces. unfamiliar yet somehow recognized. you simply know things about them. strange grace. vast architectures. spires and archways. dissolving. reforming. slow. collective unconscious. symbol and story. far older and vaster than your single life. serene. buoyant. tranquil, cradled, weightless. warm, still water. nothing to solve or analyze. delightful pageant. image flowing into image. unhurried dream logic. wholly absorbed. forget you are the one watching. compelling and unquestioned. flicker of awareness. awake inside the vision itself. deepens. colors grow richer. strange, heightened presence. waking dream. edges growing diffuse. ordinary perception loosening. more receptive. more open. creatures of strange beauty. drift before you. their emotions, their intentions, their histories. dissolving and reforming. deep reservoir. flowing beneath individual minds. serene, unhurried, buoyant. floating. weightless. simply allow. image flowing into image. dream logic. immersed so completely. figures and landscapes. a flicker of awareness will arise. within a dream. paradoxical. this knowing does not dispel the imagery but deepens it. edges sharpen. pulses. heightened presence. stillness. softening. diffuse. sand sifting. open fingers. blurs into something gentler. what lies beneath. mysterious. recognized. strange beauty. strange grace. vast. archways. you know what these places are. collective unconscious. symbol. story. vaster. older. figures and landscapes pass before you. unhurried. buoyant. cradled. nothing to do but watch. enjoy. delightful pageant. each one arriving and departing. dream logic. wholly absorbed. flowing world of image and symbol. forget. watching. compelling. unquestioned. knowledge arriving whole and certain. awareness. you realize you are within a dream. awake. vision. paradoxical. knowing. deepens. richer. sharpen. strange. presence. waking dream. settle into stillness. conscious mind. soften. edges. diffuse. perception loosening. sand. fingers. focus blurs. gentler. receptive. open. beneath. characters drift. faces. unfamiliar. recognized. without needing to be told. creatures. beauty. grace. architectures. earthly. spires. dissolving. reforming. slow. surfacing from the collective unconscious. symbol and story. flowing. beneath. minds. older. vaster. life. serene. unhurried. floating. tranquil. cradled. weightless. warm, still water. watch. enjoy. nothing to solve. allow. delightful pageant. unfolding. image. arriving. departing. unhurried. dream logic. absorbed. immersed. completely. flowing world. image. symbol. you are watch. figures. landscapes. simply be. unquestioned. their meanings arriving unbidden. flicker of awareness. arise. realize. dream. awake inside the vision. paradoxical. knowing does not dispel. deepens. colors richer. edges sharpen. in a language older than words. strange, heightened presence.
