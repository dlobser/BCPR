Notice any sensation of warmth or openness in your chest as you breathe with the pacer. Allow yourself to receive the kindness you're offering, breathing naturally with the rhythm before you. Breathe with the pacer and silently offer these words to yourself: may I be happy. Let each breath carry the intention of genuine care for your own wellbeing. As you breathe with the pacer, notice that kindness is not something you create but something you allow. Breathe naturally with the rhythm and offer to yourself: may I be healthy.

As you follow the breathing rhythm, bring to mind someone who has caused you difficulty. Breathe with the pacer and, however challenging, offer: may you be happy to this difficult person. Feel how forgiveness is not about condoning actions but about freeing yourself from the burden of resentment. Notice that even difficult people are caught in patterns of suffering just as you sometimes are. As you breathe with the rhythm, offer to the difficult person: may you be healthy. Recognize that your ability to extend kindness to enemies demonstrates the unlimited nature of love. Breathe with the pacer and offer: may you be at peace to someone who has hurt you. Feel how practicing loving kindness for difficult people dissolves the knots of anger in your own heart. As you follow the breathing pace, extend these wishes to all beings everywhere: may all beings be happy. Breathe with the rhythm and feel your heart opening to encompass every conscious creature.
