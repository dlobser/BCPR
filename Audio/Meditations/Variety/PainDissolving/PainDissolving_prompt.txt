Welcome to Pain Dissolving meditation, a practice that reveals how much of what we call pain is actually our resistance to sensation; you will discover that physical discomfort has layers - the sensation itself and your reaction to it; learning to separate these layers often reduces the intensity of the experience; breathe along with the pacer throughout this session.

Notice any area of discomfort in your body right now without trying to change it. Observe how your mind immediately wants to label sensations as good or bad. Breathe with the pacer and allow your attention to rest gently on any physical tension. Let yourself be curious about the exact qualities of the sensation you're experiencing. Notice if the sensation has temperature, pressure, or movement associated with it. Observe how the discomfort actually changes from moment to moment when you watch it closely. Allow your breath to flow with the pacer while maintaining awareness of the sensation. Notice any mental commentary about the pain and let those thoughts pass by. Observe the difference between the raw sensation and your story about what it means. Let your attention rest on the sensation without trying to make it go away. Notice how resistance to pain often creates more tension in your body. Breathe with the pacer and observe if the sensation has clear edges or boundaries. Allow yourself to be interested in how the sensation moves or shifts over time. Notice any urge to escape the feeling and simply observe that urge without acting on it. Observe how your relationship to the sensation changes when you stop fighting it. Let the pacer guide your breathing as you maintain gentle attention on the discomfort. Notice that consciousness itself remains unharmed by any sensation that arises within it. Observe how physical sensations are like weather patterns that come and go. Allow the sensation to be exactly as it is without needing to fix or change it. Notice how your body naturally breathes with the pacer even when you're not thinking about it. Observe that you are the awareness in which all sensations appear and disappear. Let yourself discover what happens when you relax around the edges of discomfort. Notice how sensations lose their solid quality when you examine them closely. Observe the space around the sensation and how it feels different from the sensation itself. Allow your breathing to flow with the pacer while watching how pain comes in waves. Notice that even intense sensations are made of constantly changing components. Observe how your mental resistance creates a second layer of suffering on top of sensation. Let yourself be amazed by your capacity to remain aware during physical discomfort. Notice how the sensation affects your breathing and let the pacer help you stay steady. Observe that painful sensations are not solid objects but flowing experiences. Allow yourself to rest in the awareness that observes all sensations without being damaged by them. Notice how your attitude toward pain completely changes the quality of your experience. Observe that consciousness can hold any sensation with perfect equanimity. Let the pacer support your breathing as you discover the impermanent nature of all sensation. Notice that you are not the pain but the awareness in which pain appears.
