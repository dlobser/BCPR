Welcome to this Progressive Muscle Relaxation meditation where you systematically tense and release each muscle group to discover deep physical calm; this practice teaches your body the difference between tension and relaxation by first creating deliberate tightness then letting it go completely; the contrast helps you recognize where you hold stress and trains your muscles to release more fully; breathe along with the visual pacer you see before you. This Progressive Muscle Relaxation session helps you develop awareness of physical tension while learning to release it through deliberate muscle contractions followed by complete letting go; by tensing muscles first, you create a clear reference point that makes the subsequent relaxation feel deeper and more noticeable; each cycle of tension and release brings you closer to profound physical calm; follow the rhythm of the pacer as your guide. Welcome to this practice of Progressive Muscle Relaxation where you learn to work with your body's natural ability to release stress through conscious muscle control; this meditation involves briefly tensing specific muscle groups then allowing them to soften completely, creating waves of relaxation that spread throughout your entire body; the breath supports each cycle of tension and release; align your breathing with the pacer you observe.
