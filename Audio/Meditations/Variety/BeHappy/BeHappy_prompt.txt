Feel your heart opening to include every form of life on this planet. As you follow the breathing rhythm, offer these words to all humans everywhere: may all people be happy. Notice that wishing happiness for everyone requires no explanation or justification, it simply feels right. Extend your care to every animal, from the smallest insect to the largest whale. Feel how your breath connects you to the breathing of every creature on earth. Offer happiness to all the animals you've ever loved. Breathe naturally with the pacer and send love to all the animals you've never met. Notice how extending kindness to creatures dissolves the artificial boundary between human and animal consciousness. Wish happiness on every bird flying through the sky right now. Feel care flowing toward every fish swimming in every ocean. Send love to every tree growing on this earth as you breathe with the natural rhythm. Offer happiness to every flower blooming and every seed taking root. Feel how plants and trees are also forms of consciousness deserving of love and care. Extend goodwill to the very soil that supports all life. Send love to every mountain reaching toward the sky. Breathe with the pacer and wish happiness on every river flowing to the sea. Notice how the earth itself seems to breathe along with you when you offer it love. Extend care to every cloud drifting across the sky. Send love upward to the sun and moon and stars. Feel how your love can reach as far as space itself when not confined by fear. As you follow the breathing pace, wish happiness specifically on someone who has hurt you deeply. Notice that offering love to enemies frees you from the prison of resentment. Send genuine care to every person who has ever caused you pain. Extend love even to those who seem to cause harm in the world. Notice that wishing happiness on enemies doesn't mean approving of their actions but recognizing their underlying suffering. Breathe with the rhythm and feel how forgiveness is simply the absence of resistance to what is. Offer love to every politician, every leader, every person in power. Send care to every person who disagrees with your deepest beliefs. Extend happiness to every stranger you pass on the street. Offer love to every person who feels lonely or afraid right now. Send care to every person who is dying in this moment, breathing with the natural pace. Wish happiness on every person being born right now. Feel your love encompassing every form of consciousness in the universe. Notice how universal love reveals that separation was always just a thought, never a reality. Rest in the recognition that loving all beings is your most natural state.
