The fish have learned to walk but only backwards, their scales catching fire from the sulfur rain that tastes like burnt communion wafers. A man with the head of a funnel pours liquid mercury into his own ear while humming a tune that makes the dead grass grow teeth. The sky is the color of infected wounds, and sometimes it blinks. Three-legged dogs chase wheels that roll uphill, their barks forming geometric patterns in the ash-thick air. The trees have inverted themselves, roots reaching toward the weeping heavens while their branches burrow deep into the earth's festering core. A woman's torso sprouts seven arms, each hand holding a different fruit that screams when bitten. The rivers flow with molten honey and ground bone, carrying boats made of giant ears that can only hear the confessions of the damned. Birds nest inside human skulls, laying eggs that hatch into tiny clockwork angels with broken wings. The horizon curves impossibly, folding back on itself like origami made from human skin. Flowers bloom from severed limbs planted in gardens of salt and sorrow, their petals sharp enough to slice through human fingernails. A cathedral grows from a massive ribcage, its stained glass windows depicting scenes that shift like oil on water. The sun has split into seventeen smaller suns, each one casting shadows in purple, green, and burnt orange. Naked figures dance around a bonfire made of burning books, their faces replaced by mirrors that reflect only black smoke. A giant owl with human hands for feet plays a harp strung with intestines, each note summoning butterflies with razor blade wings. The ground breathes beneath your feet, exhaling warm air that smells of rotting flowers. Mushrooms the size of cathedrals sprout musical instruments for stems, playing symphonies that make your teeth vibrate and your skull ring like a bell. A procession of headless monks carries lanterns filled with writhing white worms, following a path made of broken vertebrae. The air tastes like copper pennies and wet clay. Snails leave trails of liquid silver that form spirals and zigzag patterns across the cracked earth, their shells gleaming like polished bone. A tree bears fruit shaped like human hearts, each one beating at a different speed, some fast as hummingbird wings, others slow as dying breath. The wind carries the sound of a thousand church bells submerged in thick honey. Enormous insects with human faces discuss philosophy while consuming the corpses of angels, their mandibles clicking in perfect iambic pentameter. A fountain spurts blood that transforms into butterflies before hitting the ground, where they immediately burst into flames. The mountains have learned to walk, leaving footprints filled with the tears of saints. A ladder extends infinitely upward into the bruised sky, its rungs made from human vertebrae, while demons in business suits climb down carrying briefcases full of squirming maggots. The grass grows in perfect spirals, each blade sharp enough to slice through leather. Wheelbarrows full of eyeballs are pushed by figures whose shadows stretch backwards instead of forwards. Rain falls upward, each drop heavy as mercury, carrying bits of ash and bone fragments toward clouds made of compressed gray matter. A massive severed head serves as a tavern where the dead drink wine that bubbles and steams like acid. The air shimmers with visible heat waves, thick enough to part with your hands. Horses with human torsos for heads gallop in perfect circles around a maypole made of twisted spinal columns, their hoofbeats drumming wet slapping sounds against the mud. A forest of legs grows from the earth, each foot wearing a different style of shoe, some still twitching. The moon has cracked like an egg, leaking yellow fluid that pools into steaming lakes. Enormous ears sprout from the ground like flesh-colored flowers, their wax dripping continuously into small pools of amber liquid. A ship sails through the air, its hull split open to reveal tiny people crawling through its wooden intestines. The silence weighs heavy as wet wool, pressing against your eardrums until they pop. A parade of musical instruments plays itself while marching through valleys of broken glass, the brass gleaming with condensation and blood. The shadows cast by clouds form patterns that shift like spilled ink, growing darker and more solid than the objects that cast them. Every footstep squelches in mud that might be soil or might be something else entirely.
