The following is a meditation on death and impermanence. It is a grotesque horror story, made for Halloween. Someday... you will be gone. You, and Everyone you know will die. You will be forgotten. Focus on your parts, be grateful for them, and say goodbye to your body.| Your hair will fall away, Goodbye hair. Your toes shriveled, then falling off one at a time, goodbye toes. Your eyes will melt, like wax, dripping down your face, goodbye eyeballs. Your ears will grow larger as you age, sprouting hair, then they'll shrivel up like figs, and fall off, onto the ground, goodbye ears. Your teeth will turn yellow, become loose, and fall out of your head one at a time, your once beautiful smile will become jagged and grotesque, goodbye teeth. Your lips will become chapped and broken, seeping blood and growing scabs, eventually turning blue and falling off, flopping on the ground like smelly old fish, goodbye lips. Your throat and neck will become flabby, the skin becomes loose and dangles like the ears of a bassett hound, how embarrassing, you snip off the excess skin but everyone will know, you don't look any younger, your neck will simply fall off, and float into the sky, goodbye neck. Your shoulders will hunch and curve like question marks, the bones grinding and popping with every movement, until they simply slide down your torso like melting ice cream, goodbye shoulders. Your arms will become thin as twigs, the muscles dissolving away, until they snap off in a strong wind and cartwheel down the street, goodbye arms. Your hands will become gnarled and twisted, the fingers curling inward like the legs of a dead spider, the skin turning to paper, then to dust, scattering in the breeze, goodbye hands. Your chest will cave inward, the ribs poking through like the bars of a forgotten cage, creaking and cracking until they collapse into a pile of kindling, goodbye chest. Your stomach will bloat and gurgle, making sounds like a swamp at midnight, then deflate like an old balloon, shriveling into a wrinkled pouch before dissolving entirely, goodbye stomach. Your spine will curve and twist like a ancient tree root, each vertebra separating and dropping like dominoes, click-click-click, until your torso folds in half like a closing book, goodbye spine. Your hips will widen and crack, the joints popping loose like old hinges, until they simply detach and roll away down a hill, goodbye hips. Your legs will become wobbly as jelly, the knees buckling backward, the skin sagging like pantyhose filled with pudding, until they topple over and march away without you, goodbye legs. Your feet will swell like rising dough, the toes fusing together into flippers, the heels cracking open like dried earth, before they waddle off into the fog, goodbye feet.| Bring gratitude to every day, to every breath, for someday you will breathe your last. There is no escaping death. Your body is temporary, a borrowed collection of parts that will one day return to the earth. So while you still have your strange and wonderful flesh, your beating heart, your thinking brain, cherish it all. Love fiercely in this moment, for this moment is all you truly have. Death is not the enemy, it is the teacher that reminds us to live.
