Feel the weight of countless pieces of candy filling both your pockets as you breathe with the pacer. Notice how your house overflows with candy in every room, every drawer, every surface covered in sweet abundance. Sense the fullness in your belly where candy has created a warm, satisfied feeling that spreads through your entire body. Feel candy syrup slowly running down from the corners of your mouth, sticky and sweet against your skin. Breathe with the pacer and notice how abundance feels different from wanting or craving. Your pockets bulge with so much candy that you can barely fit your hands inside them. Allow yourself to feel completely satisfied as candy syrup coats your lips and chin. Notice every room in your house contains more candy than you could eat in a lifetime. Feel the gentle pressure in your stomach where candy creates a sense of perfect fullness. Candy syrup drips from your mouth while you breathe slowly with the pacer rhythm. Your pockets contain every type of candy you have ever loved, and many you have never tried. Sense how your house has become a wonderland where candy replaces all ordinary objects. Feel your belly round and warm with the sweet nourishment of endless candy. Sticky candy syrup runs down your neck as you continue breathing with the pacer. Notice that abundance feels peaceful rather than overwhelming when you truly accept it. Your pockets are so full of candy that pieces spill out with every movement you make. Every surface in your house gleams with colorful candy that catches the light beautifully. Feel how your belly holds candy without any discomfort, only pure satisfaction and warmth. Candy syrup flows freely from your mouth as a sign of life's endless sweetness.

Notice how your house transforms into a palace of sweetness where every step brings new discoveries. Feel your belly as a container of joy where candy represents all the good things in life. Candy syrup covers your hands as you touch your face, spreading sweetness everywhere. Allow abundance to feel natural and deserved as you continue breathing with the pacer. Your pockets hold candy from every country and culture, representing global abundance. Sense how your house becomes a sanctuary of sweetness where every breath tastes like candy. Feel your belly filled with candy that dissolves into pure contentment and peace. Notice candy syrup dripping onto your clothes without any concern or need to clean it. Breathe with the pacer and understand that abundance is your natural state of being. Your pockets overflow with candy that regenerates faster than you can give it away. Every corner of your house reveals new types of candy that you never knew existed. Feel your belly as a source of endless satisfaction where candy transforms into lasting joy. Candy syrup runs down your arms as a reminder that sweetness touches every part of your experience.
