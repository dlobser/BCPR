In this meditative science lesson, you will learn about some of the ways that rhythmic light and sound patterns synchronize with your brain's natural frequencies; This process, called entrainment, happens naturally when your brain begins to match the rhythm of external stimuli, similar to how your heartbeat might sync with music or how the ticking of a clock can make you drowsy. The patterns you see in Brain Candy are inspired by the geometric visions, called form constants, that we see when experiencing certain altered states of mind. You may find that some of these candies will cause you to find yourself in an altered state of mind, which you can use for relaxation, focus, creativity, and deeper states of awareness.This lesson consists of facts presented in random order, so each time you restart, it will be different, and you might find your curiosity drawn to learning more about the fascinating workings of the brain. | Notice how your thalamus acts as a relay station, filtering sensory information as it travels to your cortex. Rhythmic light pulses at 10 Hz can synchronize your alpha brain waves with the external stimulus. Binaural beats create a phantom third tone that exists only in your brain's auditory processing. Your visual cortex responds to flickering patterns even with your eyes closed. Form constants like lattices, spirals, tunnels and cobwebs appear when your brain's visual processing becomes hyperactive. Entrainment happens when your neurons begin firing in rhythm with external pulses. Your brain's frequency following response automatically matches external rhythms. Delta waves at 1-4 Hz correspond to deep sleep and physical recovery states. Theta waves at 4-8 Hz create states of creativity and deep reflection. Feel how alpha waves at 8-12 Hz generate wakeful relaxation and meditative awareness. Beta waves at 12-40 Hz produce focused alertness and problem-solving states. Gamma waves above 30 Hz correlate with heightened awareness and binding consciousness. Your retinal ganglion cells respond to light frequency changes even through closed eyelids. Visual entrainment works because 40% of your cortex processes visual information. Stroboscopic light creates hyperconnectivity between different brain regions. Your brain's default mode network shifts when exposed to rhythmic stimulation. Notice how the superior colliculus in your brainstem processes flickering light patterns. Neural entrainment can guide you into states that normally require years of meditation practice. Your pineal gland responds to light frequency changes affecting melatonin production. Cortical columns in your visual cortex create the geometric patterns of form constants. Your corpus callosum synchronizes left and right brain hemisphere activity. Entrainment creates coherence between distant brain regions through synchronized oscillations. Your brain's natural rhythms can be gently guided rather than forced into new patterns. Photic driving occurs when light pulses override your brain's natural alpha rhythm. Sense how your occipital cortex transforms light patterns into conscious visual experiences. Checkerboard patterns emerge from the hexagonal structure of your visual cortex. Tunnel visions arise from the radial organization of your retino-cortical mapping. Spiral patterns reflect the mathematical architecture of your visual processing areas. Cobweb forms correspond to the interconnected network structure of your neurons. Your brain creates self-luminous geometric patterns through internal neural activity. Light entering through your eyes travels to your suprachiasmatic nucleus affecting circadian rhythms. Frequency-matched arrhythmic stimulation produces fewer effects than rhythmic patterns. Feel how your brain's plasticity allows new neural pathways to form during entrainment sessions. 10 Hz rhythmic stimulation produces the most vivid form constant experiences. Your limbic system responds to altered brainwave states with emotional shifts. The frequency following response demonstrates your brain's natural tendency toward synchronization. Neuroplasticity means your brain physically changes with regular entrainment practice. Your prefrontal cortex shows increased activity during certain frequency ranges. Your amygdala's fear response diminishes during alpha wave entrainment states. Your hippocampus involved in memory formation becomes more active during theta states.

Your neurotransmitter production shifts during different frequency entrainment sessions. Dopamine levels can increase during pleasurable entrainment experiences. Serotonin production affects your mood during and after light stimulation sessions. GABA activity increases during relaxing alpha wave entrainment. Acetylcholine release enhances focus during beta frequency stimulation. Your brain wave patterns naturally synchronize with steady external rhythms. Mathematical principles behind Turing patterns create the geometry of form constants. Sense how noise in your neural networks actually enhances the formation of geometric patterns. Your visual cortex contains the blueprint for all possible form constant variations. Stochastic resonance makes your brain more sensitive to weak rhythmic signals. Your brain's inherent connectivity patterns determine which forms you'll perceive. Form constants appear in cave paintings because they're universal human experiences. Your retinal cells continue responding to light patterns even in complete darkness. Afterimages from rhythmic stimulation can persist for minutes after the light stops. Your brain's prediction mechanisms create expectations about incoming rhythm patterns. Cross-modal plasticity allows sound frequencies to influence visual processing areas. Feel how your vestibular system in the inner ear can be affected by certain frequency ranges. Your heart rate variability synchronizes with certain brainwave entrainment frequencies. Your breathing naturally adjusts to match rhythmic stimulation patterns. Your muscle tension decreases during successful alpha wave entrainment sessions. Your skin conductance changes reflect shifts in autonomic nervous system activity. Your blood pressure can be influenced by regular entrainment practice. Your stress hormone cortisol levels decrease during relaxing frequency sessions. Your immune system function improves with regular stress-reducing entrainment practice. Your sleep quality enhances when you practice delta wave entrainment before bed. Notice how your creative problem-solving abilities increase during theta wave states. Your focus and attention span improve with regular beta wave entrainment training. Your emotional regulation becomes more stable with consistent practice. Your pain perception can be modified through specific frequency entrainment. Your memory consolidation improves during theta and delta wave states. Your brain's energy efficiency increases when neural networks synchronize properly. Your consciousness seems to expand during gamma wave entrainment experiences. Your sense of time can become distorted during deep entrainment states. Your peripheral vision becomes more sensitive during alpha wave sessions. Feel how your color perception intensifies during certain frequency stimulation patterns. Your spatial awareness shifts during form constant visualization experiences. Your proprioception changes during states of altered consciousness. Your brain's mirror neuron system becomes more active during group entrainment sessions. Your social bonding increases when practicing entrainment with others. Your empathy and compassion naturally expand during heart-coherent states.
