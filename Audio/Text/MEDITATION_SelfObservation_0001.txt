Welcome to this Self-Observation meditation about the multiplicity of consciousness; this practice helps you recognize that what you think of as "you" is actually a collection of different mental processes arising and passing away; the illusion of a unified self dissolves as you watch thoughts, sensations, and decisions appearing without a central controller; breathe along with the pacer as you settle into this exploration of what you truly are. This Self-Observation session reveals how decisions emerge from unconscious processes before you're even aware of them; awareness itself is like a spotlight that illuminates only a small portion of the vast mental activity happening beneath the surface; you'll discover that the feeling of being in control is just another experience arising in consciousness; follow the pacer with your breath as you prepare to witness the automatic nature of your mental life. Welcome to Self-Observation meditation focused on seeing through the illusion of a separate self; this practice shows you that consciousness is more like a river than a rock, constantly flowing and changing without a fixed center; you contain multitudes of different voices, impulses, and perspectives that arise and dissolve moment by moment; breathe with the pacer as you open to discovering the spacious awareness that witnesses all these mental events.

Notice how thoughts appear in awareness without your permission or control. Watch as the breath moves your body while you follow the pacer you see before you. Observe that the sense of being a separate self is just another experience arising in consciousness. Feel how decisions seem to make themselves before you're consciously aware of choosing. Notice the different mental voices that comment on your experience throughout this session. Watch how the body breathes itself in rhythm with the pacer without your active involvement. Observe that what you call "yourself" is actually a collection of changing sensations and thoughts. Feel how awareness itself remains constant even as its contents continuously shift. Notice that the impulse to control your breathing dissolves when you trust the pacer's rhythm. Watch how multiple perspectives about this meditation arise simultaneously in your mind. Observe that consciousness is like an open space in which all experiences appear and disappear. Feel how the boundary between breathing and being breathed becomes unclear. Notice how the sense of effort fades when you allow the pacer to guide your breath naturally. Watch how different parts of your mind react to letting go of control. Observe that the feeling of being located behind your eyes is just another sensation. Feel how your body knows how to breathe perfectly without your conscious management. Notice how thoughts about the meditation arise from nowhere and dissolve back into nowhere. Watch how the pacer becomes like a gentle current that carries your breathing effortlessly. Observe that what you think of as your personality is a collection of changing patterns. Feel how consciousness itself has no center, no fixed point from which you observe. Notice how the desire to do this meditation correctly comes from an invisible source. Watch how your attention moves without anyone directing it from a central location. Observe that the space of awareness contains all experiences without being affected by them. Feel how following the pacer happens automatically once you stop trying to control it. Notice how different emotions toward this practice arise from different parts of your mind. Watch how the boundary between observer and observed dissolves in pure awareness. Observe that consciousness is like a mirror that reflects everything without holding onto anything. Feel how your breath finds its natural harmony with the pacer when you cease interfering. Notice how the sense of being someone who meditates is just another experience in awareness. Watch how thoughts about having no self arise from the same source as thoughts about having a self. Observe that awareness itself is like empty space that allows all experiences to appear. Feel how the pacer guides your breathing like a river guides a leaf floating downstream. Notice how multiple interpretations of this meditation exist simultaneously in your consciousness. Watch how the feeling of progress or lack of progress arises without your conscious choice. Observe that what you are most fundamentally is the awareness in which all experiences arise and pass away.
